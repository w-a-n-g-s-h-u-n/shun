 * A {@link JWKSource} used for reactive applications that returns the {@link JWK} from the {@link JWKContext}.

 * <p>
 * The Nimbus {@link JWKSource} is a blocking API which means the {@link JWK} cannot be resolved using code that blocks. This means that the JWK Set could not be retrieved from HTTP endpoint. To work around this the {@link JWK} is resolved in the {@link ReactiveJwtDecoder} and provided via the {@link JWKContext}.
